 <h1 style="text-align: center;">Trivia</h1>

 <p style="text-align: center;">□ When Saban Entermainment recieved the liscencing for the english version of the series, transcripts/information regarding the contents of the episodes were either missing or poorly translated. <br> To remedy this producer Andy Thomas and his production team watched audioless episodes in no particular order and wrote a story based off of what was being seen</p>

  <p style="text-align: center;">□ The Villainous character Bad Max's name is a play on the movie character Mad Max</p>

   <p style="text-align: center;">□ In-show, Seymour Cheese (also known as The Big Cheese) is known to be a horrible singer. <br> Ironically his English voice actor Dean Hagopian started out as the lead singer for the Canadian rock band *The Stacattos*</p>

    <p style="text-align: center;">□ Much like how the English names for all the characters on references to pop culture, <br> in the Spanish version the cast is named after pre-existing characters from different media</p>

    <p style="text-align: center;">□ The main characters were almost in a fighting game for the Wii called Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Ultimate All-Stars. <br> The game's producer said that many people asked for Samurai Pizza Cats characters. But they couldn't agree to include them.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center;">□ The Rude Noise (A team of villains in the series) are counterparts to the Rescue Team, a cast of side characters that make appearances every now and then that aid the main trio</p>
