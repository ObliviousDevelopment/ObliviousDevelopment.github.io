      <p style="margin-top: 0;">
        The former third in command of the Ninja Crows. He also is Speedy's main rival. His greatest ambition is to be as evil and powerful as his father (who was the original Bad Bird or Dirty Bird). <br> He carries out most of the Big Cheese's schemes to become the emperor or defeat the Pizza Cats. He sometimes spies on the Big Cheese when the Big Cheese talks to Jerry Atric about their latest plan. <br> Bad Bird has almost defeated the Pizza Cats a few times. The main reasons why he fails are because the Big Cheese, Jerry, the Ninja Crows, or the robots screw up the plans,<br> but he has also been defeated even when he fought the Pizza Cats by himself.

        who is often referred to as the Big Cheese, is the prime minister of Little Tokyo and the main antagonist of the Samurai Pizza Cats. In the Japanese version, he is a fox. <br> But in the English version, he identifies himself as a rat. Seymour is one of the members of the royal council in the public image but has big ambitions to overthrow the emperor and take over Little Tokyo. <br> As the supreme commander of the Ninja Crows clan, he tries to seize control but is invariably thwarted by the heroes or his own incompetence.

      <p style="margin-top: 0;">
        An elderly crow and Big Cheese's trusted advisor and leader of the Ninja Crows. His voice of reason counterbalances the Big Cheese's impulsive nature. The episode "Samurai Savings Time" explains how Jerry Atric <br> and the Ninja Crows became loyal to Seymour Cheese fifteen years earlier. While on a journey, Seymour stumbles upon the house where the crows were taking care of a very-ill Jerry. Desperately hungry, <br> the Big Cheese dashes for the food he sees in the hut, but accidentally trips on the threshold and falls on Jerry, kissing him. The kiss revitalizes Jerry who immediately runs around in disgust to the joy of the Ninja Crows, <br> afterwards he and his clan pledge their allegiance to Seymour as their gratitude.

    <div style="flex: 1;">
      <p style="margin-top: 0;">
        The leader of the Pizza Cats and one of the main protagonists of the series. He is also a cheery, efficient guy who, as his name implies, is the most agile, nimble, and fastest ninja on his toes, <br> a trait that comes in handy both when delivering pizzas and fighting crime. But due to his hot-blooded nature, Speedy often gets carried away with his emotions and can never abandon someone in trouble; <br> it's for that very reason that Guido and Polly recognize him as their leader. He can also be rather cocky and big-headed at times, which inevitably leads to screw-ups where it really counts.

      <p style="margin-top: 0;">
        One of the main protagonists of the series. He is the resident cool dude and the most relaxed member of the group. Guido is often seen chasing after girls, despite having little to no success in romance. <br> He also has a laid-back, playboy-like attitude, but he does springs into action when crime is afoot (or when a dazzling damsel catches his eye).

    <div style="flex: 1;">
      <p style="margin-top: 0;">
        The only female member of the team. Polly battles the forces of evil with the power of love; she plays her beloved flute before doing her roll call, her projectile weapons are heart-shaped, <br> and she has a sword with hearts on the handle (Bitou Kirakira) with her special move, Heart Breaker, as the hidden power inside of it. Additionally, by raising her forearms and making a beckoning cat-like gesture with her hands, <br> Polly can somehow generate a gravitational field that pulls her enemies in the close range of her razor-sharp claws, which leads to comedic results.

        The feline owner of the Pizza Cat Restaurant. She does not actively participate in missions, but still plays a vital role whenever the Samurai Pizza Cats are needed, either pizza delivery or battling evil. <br> She also handles communications and finances and is known in the English version for speaking in rhyme. She has terrible aiming at most times when she fires the Pizza Cat Cannon, <br> often times missing the target entirely, or sending the Pizza Cats flying through buildings.
